                  South Adams Street is a major access route for getting to
                  South Tacoma Station and is also home to local residents,
                  businesses, and destinations for community recreation. It
                  currently has discontinuous and aging sidewalks on the east
                  side of the street and a section of newer sidewalk on the west
                  side, but only from South 66th Street to the southern SERA
                  Campus parking lot. The goal for the South Adams Street
                  connections is to ensure that people of all ages and abilities
                  can safely walk, bike, or roll to South Tacoma Station and
                  SERA Campus.

                    rolling, and biking on the park property north of here, and

              In terms of bicycle access today, South Adams Street has sharrows,
              or road markings for bikes to share the street with cars. Last
              year we studied adding
              <button
                class="tooltip-anchor"
                data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                data-bs-placement="top"
                title="A protected bike lane has some form of physical separation between bicyclists and motor vehicle travel lanes, like parked cars, bollards, or curbs, but the bike lane is still part of the roadway. "
              >
                protected bike lanes
              </button>
              on the west side of South Adams Street from South 58th Street to
              South 66th Street. Another name for this is a two-way cycle track,
              as there would be bike lanes in both directions on one side of the
              street. Building protected bike lanes on South Adams Street would
              require removing on-street parking from one side of the street.
              When Sound Transit started talking with community members about
              this proposal during outreach in 2022, we heard concerns from
              local businesses about on-street parking loss

              <h3>What's changed?</h3>
              <p>
                Our proposal for South Adams Street includes filling in the
                missing sidewalks and curb ramps on the east side of South Adams
                from South 66th Street to South 56th Street. For the west side
                of the street, we’ve refined two concepts from last year into
                one hybrid design for further study that combines some
                pedestrian and bike facilities.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Section 1: In the southern end of the corridor (South 66th
                  Street to the north end of the south SERA parking lot), we’re
                  proposing to construct on-street protected bike lanes. Parking
                  would be removed on the west side of the street in this
                  vicinity (approximately 30 stalls) to make room for the
                  protected bike lanes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Section 2: Between the south SERA parking lot and S 60th
                  Street we’re proposing a shared use path on the SERA Campus.
                  The shared use path would require a partnership with Metro
                  Parks Tacoma and would not affect on-street parking. It would
                  be used by pedestrians and bicyclists and separated from cars.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Our environmental findings show that some landscaping or
                      trees along the east edge of SERA Campus may need to be
                      removed in this area. We would comply with replacement
                      requirements as necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We would also fill in missing sidewalks and curb ramps on
                      the west side of South Adams Street from South 60th Street
                      to South 56th Street.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This new approach for the west side of South Adams Street will
                provide better connections for people walking, biking, and
                rolling in the area and will result in less on-street parking
                loss (approximately 30 spaces) compared to the full two-way
                cycle track option, which would have removed over 90 spaces.

              Our preliminary cost estimate for these improvements is in the $3
              million to $6 million range. As a Priority 1 improvement, we
              anticipate being able to make these changes unless there are
              unforeseen challenges with design or construction costs. After the
              project’s environmental review finishes early next year, the Sound
              Transit Board will select the improvements to build. All
              improvements are expected to be completed by 2030.
