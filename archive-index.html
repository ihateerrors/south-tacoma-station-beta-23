                  Sound Transit is investing in better walking, rolling,
                  bicycling, and bus facilities in South Tacoma. Whether you
                  catch the train at the South Tacoma Station, or live or work
                  in the area, the upgrades will make navigating these areas
                  safer and more accessible for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fall of 2022, we announced potential street and sidewalk
                  improvements. We’ve continued refining the improvements this
                  year. Sound Transit may need to prioritize certain
                  improvements over others based on design and construction
                  costs. Read on and learn more, then give us your opinion on
                  which improvements you’d like to see built!

                    is a Sounder Train, someone scanning their ticket, someone
